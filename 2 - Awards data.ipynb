    "### Introduction to Notebook: \n",
    "\n",
    "After I finished creating the initial notebook, I realized I could make the data stronger by adding in awards information like the Oscars and Emmys. To be clear, this is only pertaining to the actors and directors - I'm not checking if the movie or TV show itself won Best Picture or Best Series, as that is unavailable information from the perspective of my project. Meaning if someone were to use this model to decide whether or not make a movie, they of course would not have information about this hypothetical movie winning a Best Picture Oscar.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if someone were to cast an Oscar winning actor in the movie, logically the chances of its success increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "One question that I wrestled with is whether I should exclude Oscars won for the movie in question. Meaning if, say, 'Training Day' is part of my train set, should I exclude Denzel Washington's acting oscar in that row because we won it for that performance? And is that a form of data leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end I decided to keep it, as Oscar wins are only meant to check whether a particular actor has won an Oscar at any time in their career. And if you added an Oscar-calibre actor to your movie (whether it's before or after they actually won the Oscar), chances are your movie will be more successful because of the acting ability they are bringing to the table, not because of the award itself.\n"
